# Agent Workbench engineering invariants

- This repository is a generic, local Agent Workbench. It is not a Codex-specific coding application.
- Workbench core must not depend on Codex, Claude, Devin, GitHub, Git, Snowflake, Data Vault, or any other concrete integration. Integration-specific behavior belongs behind adapters.
- First-party features use the same registries, commands, slots, prompt contributions, and provider seams intended for later extensions.
- A View is persisted UI state; a Session is a runtime resource. They are separate concepts, and not every View needs a Session.
- Agent command construction, configuration, and native event parsing belong to the provider adapter. Generic views consume only AgentProvider/AgentSession APIs.
- Process and PTY lifecycle belongs outside React components. React may acquire a session controller and must dispose it on unmount.
- Privileged Node and Electron capabilities remain in the main process and are exposed to the renderer only through narrow, typed preload APIs. Never expose arbitrary process execution.
- Use accessible/headless primitives for common interactions instead of rebuilding focus, keyboard, selection, dialog, menu, or tooltip behavior.
- Product styling consumes semantic `--wb-*` theme variables. Feature components must not add literal product colors.
- Prefer the smallest abstraction supported by current needs or explicitly planned consumers. Do not create speculative plugin frameworks or future infrastructure; leave a clean extension seam instead.
- Keep the application local-first unless a feature explicitly requires an external service.
- Preserve working architectural boundaries. Refactor only when a concrete requirement makes the current boundary inadequate.
